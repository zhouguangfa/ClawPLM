## ClawPLM Project Development

Today worked on building and deploying the ClawPLM (Product Lifecycle Management) system with the following accomplishments:

1. **System Architecture**:
   - Designed microservices architecture with API Gateway, PDM service, Project service, and Workflow service
   - Implemented frontend using Vue.js with Element Plus UI
   - Configured MySQL database with proper schema
   - Integrated Kafka for message queuing

2. **Docker Configuration**:
   - Created comprehensive docker-compose.yml for all services
   - Fixed multiple Dockerfile issues including:
     * Corrected base image tags (eclipse-temurin instead of openjdk)
     * Fixed shell syntax errors in Dockerfiles
     * Created individual Dockerfiles for each service
     * Improved frontend build process with proper dependencies

3. **Code Structure**:
   - Implemented complete backend services with JPA repositories, controllers, and services
   - Created frontend components for dashboard, product management, and project management
   - Developed comprehensive README with deployment instructions

4. **Deployment Fixes**:
   - Resolved Maven multi-module build issues
   - Fixed frontend build failures by adding proper build dependencies
   - Corrected Dockerfile syntax errors that were causing parsing failures
   - Optimized docker-compose configuration for proper service startup order

5. **Repository Management**:
   - Uploaded complete project to GitHub repository: zhouguangfa/ClawPLM
   - Maintained clean repository by removing OpenClaw configuration files
   - Provided detailed documentation for deployment

The ClawPLM system is now ready for deployment with all components properly configured.
